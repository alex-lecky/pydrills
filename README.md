# pydrills

Python and programming exercises for the curious!

## Getting started

Python is an obvious prerequisite.

You'll need pip (<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>) to install dependencies, and I highly recommend you make use of
virtualenv (<http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>).

Once you have these, run

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

to install the requirements.

pydrills comes with tests to guide your development.  To execute them, run

`nosetests`

and they will all promptly fail, because you have not completed any of the projects ... yet.

## Assignments
